'IT enthusiast (Developer/DataAnalyst/DataScientist)'

I am a computer science student who likes to create projects based on automation and data analysis in my free time. If there is a task that is repetitive, I will probably be the first person to think about a solution that could make the work easier. I like to learn about new technologies and the connections between them, recently I have been exploring the issues of Machine Learning and Cloud Technologies.
